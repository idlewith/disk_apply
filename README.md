dd if=/dev/urandom of=/root/disk_apply/new/file${i} bs=500M count=5
done
```

# make one file specially

chmod +x file4


# files usage

[cp.py](cp.py) use cp once

[cp_with_subprocess.py](cp_with_subprocess.py) use cp in multiple cores

## solution 1



What about using a Live System and

```
sudo dd if=/dev/sdx0 of=/dev/sdy0
```

and

```
sudo resize2fs /dev/sdy0
```

afterwards to resize the partition.

With sdx0 being your old partition and sdy0 being the new one.
